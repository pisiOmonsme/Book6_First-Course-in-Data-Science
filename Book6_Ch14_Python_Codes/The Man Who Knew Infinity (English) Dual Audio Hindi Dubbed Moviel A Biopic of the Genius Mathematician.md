The film follows Ramanujan's journey from his humble origins in Madras, India, where he was self-taught and faced poverty and prejudice, to his admission to Cambridge University during World War I, where he collaborated with Hardy and other eminent mathematicians. The film explores the challenges and conflicts that Ramanujan faced as he tried to prove his extraordinary theorems, which were often met with skepticism and hostility by the academic establishment. The film also depicts the personal and professional relationship between Ramanujan and Hardy, who had contrasting personalities and views on mathematics, but developed a mutual respect and admiration for each other.
 
The Man Who Knew Infinity is a tribute to the life and legacy of Ramanujan, who died at the age of 32 from tuberculosis, leaving behind a wealth of mathematical discoveries that are still being explored and verified today. The film showcases the beauty and elegance of mathematics, as well as the passion and perseverance of a genius who overcame all odds to pursue his dreams.
