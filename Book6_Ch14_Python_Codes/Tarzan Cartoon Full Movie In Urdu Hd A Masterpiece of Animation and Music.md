Tarzan is one of the most iconic characters in literature and cinema, created by Edgar Rice Burroughs in 1912. The story of a boy raised by apes in the African jungle has inspired countless adaptations, including animated cartoons. In this article, we will review one of the latest versions of Tarzan cartoon full movie in Urdu HD, which is available online for free.
 
The movie is titled **Tarzan** and it was released in 2018 by South Indian Movies Digiplex. It is a Hindi dubbed action movie that stars Sriki and Duniya Rashmi as Tarzan and Jane respectively.

The movie is a low-budget production that relies heavily on computer-generated imagery (CGI) for the animals and the jungle scenes. The quality of the animation is not very impressive, and some of the scenes look unrealistic and awkward. The voice acting is also mediocre, and the dialogues are often cheesy and clichÃ©d. The movie does not offer anything new or original to the Tarzan story, and it lacks the charm and emotion of the previous animated versions.
