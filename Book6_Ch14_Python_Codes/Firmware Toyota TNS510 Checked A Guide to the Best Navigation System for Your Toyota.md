# How to Check the Firmware Version of Your Toyota TNS 510 Navigation System
 
If you own a Toyota car with a TNS 510 navigation system, you might want to know how to check the firmware version of your device. Firmware is the programming that's written to a hardware device's non-volatile memory, which means it is not erased when the device is turned off or loses power[^2^]. Firmware updates can improve the performance and functionality of your navigation system, as well as fix any bugs or errors.
